# AutoBoost

AutoBoost is a cutting-edge tool designed to enhance automated software testing by improving fault detection through the generation of unique, rare, and unlikely test cases. This tool aims to complement existing frameworks like EvoSuite, filling in the gaps and increasing overall test suite effectiveness.

## Overview

AutoBoost is developed to address the limitations of current automated testing tools by generating additional test cases that are not covered by tools like EvoSuite. This enhancement leads to better fault detection and increased test suite comprehensiveness.

## Features

- **Test Case Generation**: Generates test cases based on existing failing tests.
- **CI Integration**: Can be smoothly integrated into Continuous Integration (CI) practices.
- **Rare and Unlikely Test Cases**: Generates test cases that target rare and unlikely execution paths and inputs.
- **Improved Mutation Coverage**: Increases the mutation coverage by identifying gaps in test suites generated by existing tools.

## Experiment Setup

Experiments to evaluate AutoBoost were conducted with the following specifications:

- **Processor**: 64-thread AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X
- **Memory**: 256GB RAM
- **Containerization**: Podman 4.4.1
- **Java Version**: OpenJDK 1.8.0 322

## Results

AutoBoost has demonstrated improvements in fault detection and coverage enhancement. The following tables summarize the key results:
